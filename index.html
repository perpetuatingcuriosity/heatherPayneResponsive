			Hi! My name&rsquo;s Heather Payne. I&rsquo;m a 26-year-old entrepreneur living in Toronto, Canada. I&rsquo;m the founder of <a href="#">HackerYou</a> and <a href="#">Ladies Learning Code</a>. I&rsquo;m also an angel investor (with one exit so far), one of <a href="#">Canada&rsquo;s 100 Most Powerful Women</a>, and I love being a role model for people who are thinking about changing their careers and their lives.	
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I grew up just outside of Toronto. In high school, I managed a McDonald&rsquo;s and also started my first entrepreneurial venture: I sold custom-printed t-shirts and used the profits to buy my prom dress. In 2009, I graduated from the Richard Ivey School of Business at (what is now known as) Western University. Back then, I had a different plan for myself. I was going to join a Fortune 500 company and work my way up.
		</p>

		<p>
			I spent my last semester of university on exchange in Hong Kong and liked it so much that I decided to stay in Asia after graduation. I moved to a small coastal city on the Chinese mainland called Xiamen and studied international relations under a scholarship from the Chinese government. I spent most of my time there learning to code.
		</p>

		<p>
			In mid-2010, I returned to Toronto and spent a year in a corporate gig before realizing that I'm better suited for the world of startups. In May of 2011, I found myself in Los Angeles and stumbled upon a Python workshop for women organized by the <a href="#">PyLadies</a>. I had an incredible time. I was so inspired that, when I returned to Toronto, I tweeted about how we should have a group in Toronto for women who want to learn how to code. And that was the start of <a href="#">Ladies Learning Code</a>. Today, we have chapters in 17 cities across Canada, a <a href="#">permanent home in Toronto</a>, and thriving <a href="#">girls&lsquo;</a> and <a href="#">youth programs</a>. Since our first workshop in August 2011, over 8000 people have learned a new technical skill at a Ladies Learning Code workshop. Haven&rsquo;t checked us out yet? You can check out our upcoming workshops and events <a href="#">here</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The idea for <a href="#">HackerYou</a> came in early 2012. We&rsquo;d learned a lot about how to teach beginners to code in a fun and interactive way, and we knew we could create an amazing long-form learning experience. HackerYou was Canada&rsquo;s first programming bootcamp, and to this day is the only bootcamp in existence that is run by women. We run both full-time and part-time courses throughout the year &#8212; maybe <a href="#">one of them</a> is a fit for you?
		</p>
			Are you also passionate about technology education, entrepreneurship, women in tech, or one of the other things I&rsquo;m into? Let&rsquo;s connect! Send me an email at <a href="#">heather [at] heatherpayne.ca</a>, find me on <a href="#">Twitter</a>, or just <a href="#">send me a note</a>. Oh, and yes, I&rsquo;m available for speaking gigs. :)
